# Week1Challenge

## User Story

* As a developer I want to refactor an existing code to properly meet accessibility standards. I want to improve the codebase without changing the layout of the live browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I properly identify semantic HTML elements in a logical structure
* It is done when I list concise and describtive alt attributes
* It is done when the live webpage satisfies the accesibility standards

## Decsription

This first challenge is an "on-the-job-ticket". This means a starter code is provided and I will have to modify the given code. It's important to improve the starter code without changing what it is already set to do. This is a most common task for front-end and junior developers.

## Review

My first challenge requires me to look at a starter code and modify the code to refactor and make more accessible and cleaner. Thank you for ReadingME:)
