# Week1Challenge

## User Story

* As a developer I want to refactor an existing code to properly meet accessibility standards. I want to improve the codebase without changing the layout of the live browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I properly identify semantic HTML elements in a logical structure
* It is done when I list concise and describtive alt attributes
* It is done when the live webpage satisfies the accesibility standards

## Decsription

This first challenge is an "on-the-job-ticket". This means a starter code is provided and I will have to modify the given code. It's important to improve the starter code without changing what it is already set to do. This is a most common task for front-end and junior developers.

## Review

My first challenge requires me to look at a starter code and modify the code to refactor and make more accessible and cleaner. Thank you for ReadingME:)

## Code Source

The starter code was given to me for this assignment in Gitlab from my instructor for the University of Texas at Autin Coding Bootcamp Course. The starter code included an original index.html and style.css that I worked to modify to complete the assignment requirements.
